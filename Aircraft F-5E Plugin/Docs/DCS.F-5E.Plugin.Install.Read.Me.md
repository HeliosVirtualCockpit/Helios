# **Helios Virtual Cockpit 1.6 Plugin: DCS F-5E Tiger II**

   
This is a plugin component for Helios Virtual Cockpit 1.6 which provides an interface and controls for the DCS F-5E Tiger II from Belsimtek.  
Helios 1.6 is not an explicit collaboration with Craig Courtney, but it relies heavily on the original Helios.  This distribution is not endorsed by Craig Courtney.   
                                                                      
Helios is Community supported, and that community exists on [Discord](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/wiki/Get-Help-with-Profiles#capt-zeen). If you encounter problems, please check for known issues [here](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/issues) and if no existing issues appear relevant, and your problem cannot be solved by the community, then open a [new issue](https://github.com/HeliosVirtualCockpit/Helios/issues) with as much detail as possible about the problem.

## **Before Installation**

 

1\) Make sure you virus scan the installation.  Helios is built on GitHub infrastructure and we believe this build system to be virus free, however we make no claims that it is virus free, and we take no responsibility for any damage to your system as a result of installation of Helios or its install mechanism.   
   
2\) The executables are not currently signed so a warning for this will be issued during installation and running of the software.  It is completely your decision and risk if you ignore warnings.
